# What it is?
It is a simple (no fancy UI) tool to fetch release information from Github with your list of FOSS Apps. <br>
If you are a FOSS enthusiast (like myself), you might have used many apps hosted on Github. If so, this tool is for you. <br>
Consider this like **'pip' from python**, except it won't automatically download anything. It just checks for **latest releases**. <br>
And you need to manually add apps by yourself.

# What does it do?
- Add entries with Github links.
- Fetch release tag from Github, on each entry.

# Why does it exist?
Most apps have their own update mechanism, which is the standard. <br>
But, you need to open those Apps individually to trigger the update check. <br>
After you open each one, you either go the release page, or it will automatically update itself. <br>
This tool helps with the former. And it removes 1 tedious step. <br>
By listing the apps, and update-check them in batch, you won't need to open the apps one by one.

# What does it need to run?
- A Windows 10 PC, with Internet Connection (otherwise, how would it connect to Github to check for updates?)
- Microsoft Net 5 runtime, [**which can be downloaded from here**](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0).
- Preferably, a computer with at least 4GB of RAM.

# Additional Info
This is the first initial release. The main focus is functionality over looks. <br>
This, however, will change as I will try to update this at least every couple months. <br>
As this is the initial release, expect some bugs and unpolished UIs. <br>
If bugs are found, report them in the Issues tab. <br>
